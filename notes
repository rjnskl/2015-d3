notes

select = returns first one
select all = returns all selections


d3.select("h1");
[Array[1]0: h1length: 1parentNode: html__proto__: Array[0]]
d3.select("h1").text("Monkeys")
[Array[1]]
d3.select("h1").attr("class","hed")
[Array[1]]
d3.select("h1").style("color", "red")
[Array[1]]

If you want to see if data join worked - click on the element in inspect element, then go into console and enter: $0.__data__


.enter() is also doing update and exit behind the scenes

.data() always comes before .enter()
